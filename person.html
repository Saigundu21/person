<h1>NIKOLA TESLA</h1>
<p>Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems. His innovations laid the foundation for modern power distribution and significantly advanced the fields of electromagnetism and wireless communication.Tesla’s work with AC power led to the widespread adoption of the system over Thomas Edison’s direct current (DC). His AC system was more efficient for transmitting electricity over long distances, revolutionizing power distribution.Tesla’s work with AC power led to the widespread adoption of the system over Thomas Edison’s direct current (DC).

Although Tesla died relatively poor and overlooked, his contributions gained recognition posthumously. Today, he is celebrated as one of the greatest inventors and visionaries in modern science and technology. The Tesla electric car company, founded by Elon Musk, was named in his honor.</p>
